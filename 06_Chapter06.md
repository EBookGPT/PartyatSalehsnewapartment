# Chapter 6: Games and Activities for the Guests

It was a lively evening at Party at Saleh's new apartment, with guests mingling and chatting away to glory. The sweet scent of freshly baked pizzas and the refreshing aroma of cocktails filled the air. Saleh's efforts to make the party a great hit were paying off as guests smiled and exuded joy.

As I was sipping my drink, I noticed the former baseball superstar, Alex Rodriguez, at a gaming table, surrounded by a group of people. They seemed to be all engrossed in a game, and I couldn't help but wonder what game it could be.

Being a curious detective that I am, I approached the group and asked what game they were playing. They responded excitedly that they were playing 'Charades,' a game where a team member pantomimes a word or phrase while the rest of the team tries to guess it.

As I watched them play, I remembered reading an article in the Journal of Social Psychology that discussed how playing games like Charades is a great way to increase social bonding and feelings of affection towards one another. I made a mental note to share this information with Saleh.

After a few rounds of Charades, Alex suggested we play 'Two Truths and a Lie,' a game where each person tells three statements about themselves, with one of them being a lie. The rest of the group then has to guess which statement is not true.

As the game went on, Alex's turn came up, and he whispered something into Saleh's ear. Saleh looked surprised and gestured towards me, inviting me to guess which statement Alex told us was false.

Alex said, "I have a pet giraffe, I once bounced a basketball for 10 hours straight, and I own a house on Mars."

I chuckled at the last statement, knowing it was obviously false. However, as I voiced my guess, Saleh's expression went from one of amusement to one of bewilderment. He then revealed to me that he had recently read an article in the Journal of Astrophysics that discussed the possibility of humans setting foot on Mars soon, and owning a house on Mars might not be the far-fetched idea that it seemed like.

We all laughed it off, but I couldn't help but appreciate Saleh's attention to detail and broad knowledge about what was happening in the world. As the night went on, we played several more games such as Jenga, Heads Up, and Cards Against Humanity. The games proved to be an excellent way to break the ice and ensure that everyone had a great time.

In the end, we all went home with joyous memories of laughter, bonding, and fun. As I walked out of Saleh's apartment, I couldn't wait to share my newfound knowledge about the power of party games with my own set of friends. The mystery of the games and activities planned for the guests at Party at Saleh's new apartment had been solved.
As the party came to an end, Saleh felt proud of the successful night that he had organized. The games and activities planned for the guests had proved to be a hit, providing an enjoyable atmosphere for everyone. With the presence of Alex Rodriguez, the party had an extra level of excitement that Saleh had hoped for.

The journal articles that had been referenced throughout the night showed the power of games to build social bonds and elevate moments of fun, and the guests had provided living proof of this. As we said our goodbyes and walked out into the night, our faces showed nothing but happiness and sheer delight.

Saleh's Party proved that a combination of a great sound system, creative activities, and of course, a high-profile guest can create an unforgettable night. The mystery around the games and activities for the guests had been indeed solved, and the answer was more profound than anyone could imagine.
