# Chapter 3: Refreshments and Food Planning

Oh, the party at Saleh's new apartment is almost here,  
And it's time to think about food and drinks, my dear!  
In Chapter 2, we talked about the guest list and invites,  
But a party's not complete without some tasty treats and bites.  

Food planning can be quite daunting, it's true,  
But fear not, my friend, we'll guide you through.  
From appetizers to drinks, we'll cover it all,  
So you can focus on having a ball.  

First things first, let's talk about the appetizers,  
Small bites that are sure to be party-pleasers.  
Think finger foods like mini quiches or sliders,  
Or veggies with dip for the healthy insider.  

Next up, let's delve into the main courses,  
Will you serve a buffet or plated food sources?  
Consider cuisines that will cater to all,  
Think vegetarian, gluten-free, and the like in recall. 

And what about the drinks, you may ask?  
A signature cocktail would be quite the task.  
Or perhaps a DIY bar with mixers and ice,  
And don't forget water and soda, oh so nice.  

Lastly, the sweet treats that we all adore,  
From cakes to cookies, and so much more.  
Think bite-sized desserts for ease of serving,  
And don't forget the napkins, plates, and all that is deserving.

So, there you have it, our food and drink plan,  
A surefire way to please every party fan.  
Now let's get cooking, chopping, and prepping,  
And soon enough, the guests will be repping.
# Chapter 3: Refreshments and Food Planning - The Mystery of the Missing Appetizers

The food and drinks were all set,  
Saleh's party was ready to be met.  
But as the guests arrived and gathered,  
The appetizers were nowhere to be discovered.  

Sherlock Holmes was called to aid,  
A mystery to solve, a case to be played.  
With his trusty magnifying glass in hand,  
He searched for clues from every strand.  

He examined the kitchen, the fridge, and all,  
But nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary at all,  
Until he noticed a spilled tray of mini quiches,  
On the countertop, between empty dishes.  

He followed the trail of crumbs and splatters,  
And soon found a window, ajar and in matter.  
The culprit had escaped, it was clear,  
But the question remained, who was the steer?  

With a closer look, Holmes noticed a hair,  
On the window sill, quite an unusual layer.  
He collected it with care and hurried back,  
His mind already working on a plan of attack.  

A quick analysis with his microscope,  
Revealed it was a dog hair, with no hope.  
For Saleh had no pet of his own,  
But his neighbor had a dog, as it was known.  

Confronted with this evidence, the neighbor soon confessed,  
He had been tempted by the appetizer's unmistakable zest.  
He thought no one would notice the missing treats,  
But little did he know, Sherlock always competes.  

The appetizers were soon replenished and served,  
And the party guests' taste buds were well deserved.  
Thanks to Holmes' keen eye and sharp wit,  
The party was saved and the culprit unfit.  

So, when planning your own party spread,  
Keep your eye out for appetizer theft, it's said.  
And if in doubt, call on Sherlock, his skills are supreme,  
And your party will be a party full of gleam.
In conclusion, the mystery of the missing appetizers was solved with the help of Sherlock Holmes. It just goes to show that even the smallest details can hold important clues when it comes to solving a mystery. When planning a party, it's important to take precautions and keep an eye out for anything suspicious, whether it's missing appetizers or uninvited guests. But in the end, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the company of your guests. So, let's raise a glass to good food and good company, and may your party be a success!
