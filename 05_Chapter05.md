# Chapter 5: Sound System Setup for the Event - The Case of the Mysterious Static

Sherlock Holmes had been called to investigate a puzzling case,
Of a party that left everyone feeling out of place.
Saleh's new apartment was the venue for the event,
And the host, perplexed about the sound's static that left the DJ bent.

Holmes arrived at the party, observing the dance floor,
The sound system's static was harsh and always a little more.
"Elementary," he declared, "the mixer's to blame,
For this unpleasant sound, we must look for the source of shame."

He took a closer look and inspected the wires, 
And he found the root cause of the sound system's fires.
The plugs, he deduced, were loose and the cables frayed,
And the signal couldn't reach the mixer in the way it was made.

The great detective then explained to Saleh,
"Faulty wiring is the culprit, of this I am quite sure. 
The cables must be replaced and the plugs re-secured,
And soon the music will be pure, sublime, and oh so assured."

Saleh thanked Holmes for his expertise and his savoir-faire, 
And asked if there were any books on the subject about which he was aware.
"Indeed," said Holmes, "there are many resources at your disposal,
The Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, for example, is quite noble."

With the cables replaced and the mixer in perfect working health,
The party could resume with sound more pleasant than anyone ever felt.
People danced and sang and drank and had a jolly fine time,
And Saleh's party became the epitome of sonic design. 

And so Saleh's mystery was solved with the power of deduction,
Thanks to Holmes' sleuthing and his unwavering induction.
The case of the Mysterious Static was solved with some cable-tie tacticians,
And Saleh's party lived on, with music that was simply fantastical, do listen.
With the mystery of the Mysterious Static solved,
Holmes had saved the party and made sure everyone evolved.
Now Saleh's new apartment was the talk of the town,
With a sound system set up that never let him down.

Thanks to Holmes' knowledge and expert deduction,
Saleh was able to throw a party that caused a sensation.
The music played on with crystal-clear precision,
Thanks to the great detective's audio acquisition.
