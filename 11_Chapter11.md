As the night drew to a close, and guests started heading back home,  
A commotion was heard in the living room, a yelp and a moan

The first suspect was Bella, who was heaving with loud sighs

But Bella had an airtight alibi, and nothing could tie her to the crime  
Next suspect up, the infamous Franklin, who had been absent for some time  


Franklin argued that he had been in the bedroom all along  
He didn't leave his place, and had no clue what had gone wrong  
But the earring was found in his pocket, the evidence had been revealed  
His alibi crumbled, and his guilt was soon unsealed  


For Sherlock had discovered the truth, with his keen sense of perception  
Franklin had found the earring accidentally, in a moment of inattention

But as the night proceeded, his guilt had been palpably profound  

And with that, the mystery was solved, and a thief brought to justice  
The party had been a success, but this parting act pure malice  
Lessons learned, that even in a joyous occasion like this  
We must always be vigilant, and never let our guard down amiss  

So, as we wrap up this chapter and reflect on the case of the missing earring  
We must remember to cherish our memory, and be careful with what we're carrying  
For even in moments of great joy, caution should be our best friend
