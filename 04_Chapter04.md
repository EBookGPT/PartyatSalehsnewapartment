# Chapter 4: Decorating for the Party with Special Guest Martha Stewart

Sherlock Holmes walked into Saleh's new apartment, his eyes scanning the room with a keen eye for detail. He was there to solve a mystery, one that had stumped the party planners.

The refreshments and food had been planned to perfection, but something was amiss, something wasn't quite right. The decorations were downright dismal, and the atmosphere felt gloomy and tight.

Martha Stewart was there too, offering her sage advice,
But even she was flummoxed, ideas failing to suffice.

The party was fast approaching, and the decorations were unfinished,
Holmes knew he had to act fast, or there'd be a party-goer admonished.

He started examining the room, paying attention to every detail,
The walls were bland, the lighting dim, causing the guest to feel frail.

He looked around the space, examining the furniture and all,
The culprit was hiding in plain sight, he knew, trying to make them fall.

And then it hit him, like a bolt from the blue,
The curtains, they were missing, causing the mood to be askew.

He found them lying on the floor, in a pile so neat,
The culprit was none other than Saleh's cat, velvety and sweet!

It had clawed at the curtains, bringing them to the ground,
And with no time to spare, Holmes got to work, determined to turn things around.

With Martha's help, they quickly put up new curtains so grand,
And added some flowers and balloons, carefully planned.

The room transformed, it was now cozy and bright,
And the decorations finally looked just right.

The party was a hit, the decorations stealing the show,
And Holmes returned home, his mystery-solving skills on full show.

The lesson here is that a party's decor is crucial, we say,
But with some creativity and a keen eye, it'll be perfect in every way!
The party was a huge success, thanks to the efforts of Sherlock Holmes and Martha Stewart. The decorations were the talk of the town, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. 

Through their combined efforts, decorated Saleh's new apartment turned into a cozy and bright space, with the perfect blend of colors, lighting, and textures. 

This mystery taught us that it's essential to pay attention to details while planning a party, from food to decor, as every element has an impact on the overall experience. 

Thanks to this team's creativity and vision, the mystery was solved, and Saleh's party was a dream come true. The guests enjoyed the party to the fullest, and everyone went back home with a smile on their faces. 

The end of this chapter marks the end of our party preparations, but stay tuned for the next one, where we'll discuss the entertainment aspect of the party.
